Test every kit. Every single one."
Biden,2019-01-30 01:31:00,"What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country.

Biden,2019-02-06 04:13:00,Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour -- to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great.
Biden,2019-02-08 03:07:00,John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title ‚Äî not just because he was there the longest ‚Äî but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.
Biden,2019-02-09 21:21:00,Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly.

Biden,2019-02-14 18:18:00,"I know from personal experience the only way to overcome grief is to find purpose.

Biden,2019-02-15 15:41:00,"Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now."
Biden,2019-02-15 15:41:00,"One in five women will still be victims of rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. On average, three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. Nothing is more urgent than reauthorizing and expanding the law that makes women safer."
Biden,2019-02-15 15:41:00,"VAWA‚Äôs power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day."
Biden,2019-02-15 15:41:00,"There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now."

Biden,2019-03-15 15:59:00,"On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today‚Äôs senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate."
Biden,2019-03-15 15:59:00,"Whether it is antisemitism in Pittsburgh, racism in Charlottesville, or the xenophobia and Islamophobia today in Christchurch, violent hate is on the march at home and abroad. We cannot stand by as mosques are turned into murder scenes."

Biden,2019-03-28 21:44:00,.@NRA opposition to a full reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is sickening. We must do more to protect victims of stalking and abuse.

Biden,2019-06-01 20:41:00,"Pride is about standing up to the voices of injustice and discrimination and declaring that everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. It's about love. We join the LGBTQ community in celebration and remember the fight is not over. We march on. Happy #PrideMonth"
Biden,2019-06-01 21:38:00,"Gun violence occurs every day across America. Enough is enough.
Not every life lost makes national headlines, but it's just as painful for those left behind. This is an epidemic plaguing our communities &amp; destroying our children‚Äôs futures. We must act now. https://t.co/PYAHoAFmjQ"
Biden,2019-06-02 02:48:00,"Thank you @HRC for having me tonight in Columbus. At a time when we‚Äôre seeing the forces of hate and intolerance push back on the progress we‚Äôve made, your courage and grit gives me hope. I will always stand beside you as we fight for equality. https://t.co/NKh1oWWuKp"
Biden,2019-06-02 14:55:00,"I‚Äôm looking forward to traveling to New Hampshire this week to talk to voters about my plans for our country.

Biden,2019-06-03 17:56:00,"We have a major problem with educational inequality and we need to tackle it head on. In a Biden Administration, we‚Äôll triple Title I funding ‚Äî creating a historic investment in schools serving a high proportion of children from low-income families. https://t.co/14A6BoG428"
Biden,2019-06-04 10:00:00,"We are in a climate emergency and we must take drastic action now to address it. So today, I‚Äôm announcing my plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice.

https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo https://t.co/SBDrdiFu2C"
Biden,2019-06-04 15:39:00,"Today, President Trump denies the evidence in front of his own eyes, hides climate science produced by his own administration, and actively works to roll back what progress we have already made.

It‚Äôs reckless, it‚Äôs irresponsible, and it‚Äôs unacceptable. https://t.co/3r9TqKKqGQ"
Biden,2019-06-04 15:43:00,"Science tells us that how we act, or fail to act, in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. As president, I will use every authority available to me to drive progress.

I will accept no half-measures.
https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ"
Biden,2019-06-04 15:50:00,"We‚Äôre going to make record-breaking investments in research and development and zero-carbon technologies so that America is the engine of the world‚Äôs clean economy.

The United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.

https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ https://t.co/ypw4o7rozG"
Biden,2019-06-04 15:59:00,"This initiative will create new, good-paying jobs all across the clean economy in the United States of America. It‚Äôs an enormous opportunity.

https://t.co/2sXQy4kQ1J https://t.co/jMzUjmXwoV"
Biden,2019-06-04 16:06:00,"We‚Äôll hold polluters accountable for the damage they've caused‚Äîparticularly in low-income communities and communities of color.

https://t.co/XZ0tkRzgl2 https://t.co/irrXklh9PF"
Biden,2019-06-04 16:14:00,"I will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on Day One. But that‚Äôs not sufficient.

I‚Äôll immediately get to work leading a diplomatic initiative to get every nation to go beyond their initial commitment‚Äîto push our progress further, and faster.

https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ https://t.co/x8X0qhu8qZ"
Biden,2019-06-04 16:18:00,"We need to dramatically accelerate our worldwide effort to meet the intensity of the challenge we face. I hope you'll read my full plan to tackle the climate emergency and environmental injustices: 
https://t.co/XJsdFWUo9j"
Biden,2019-06-04 16:20:00,"Making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels, but I know we can meet this challenge.

Because this is what America does best‚Äîsolving big problems, with big ideas. If you agree, please sign your name here: https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ"
Biden,2019-06-04 18:51:00,Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
Biden,2019-06-04 18:51:00,"China‚Äôs continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can‚Äôt be ignored. Human rights must be at the core‚Äînot periphery‚Äîof our engagement in the world."
Biden,2019-06-04 19:31:00,"Estamos enfrentando una emergencia clim√°tica y debemos tomar medidas dr√°sticas ya. Por eso, hoy, estoy anunciando mi plan para una Revoluci√≥n de Energ√≠a Limpia y Justicia Ambiental. https://t.co/QcC4JKSkvj"
Biden,2019-06-04 22:24:00,"As the sun sets around the world, Jill and I want to extend our warmest wishes to those marking the end of Ramadan. May your celebrations be filled with family and joy. #EidMubarak"
Biden,2019-06-05 19:07:00,"Spent yesterday afternoon in Plymouth, NH, discussing how we build our Clean Energy Revolution. Under our bold new plan, the United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.

Biden,2019-06-05 22:05:00,We had a great few days on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! I look forward to being back soon. https://t.co/oQA6EhBT5f
Biden,2019-06-05 23:02:00,"We can‚Äôt afford four more years of President Trump attacking the progress we‚Äôve made on climate change. On day one as president, I‚Äôll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head on. https://t.co/PTXHzn1PXM"
Biden,2019-06-06 15:55:00,"75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance."
Biden,2019-06-06 15:55:00,"With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice."
Biden,2019-06-06 15:55:00,We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved‚Äîfor all of us.
Biden,2019-06-06 15:55:00,Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world‚Äîone that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
Biden,2019-06-06 15:55:00,"Today, we honor all those who answered duty‚Äôs call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died."
Biden,2019-06-07 00:53:00,"Women‚Äôs rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we‚Äôve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone‚Äôs zip code."
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,"I know how to beat the NRA because I‚Äôve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again."
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,We can‚Äôt let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That‚Äôs why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,"We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it‚Äôs clear we need to: 
- Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check.
- Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,"Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America."
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
Biden,2019-06-07 22:05:00,We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
Biden,2019-06-07 23:45:00,"This campaign is about listening to communities and working with them to find solutions to the issues on their minds. Yesterday we held a roundtable to do just that.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me in Atlanta. https://t.co/xSyn19iT7L"
Biden,2019-06-08 14:55:00,"Make no mistake, how we act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. We‚Äôll make the largest investment in American history to tackle the climate emergency head on and protect our planet for future generations. https://t.co/XJsdFWUo9j"
Biden,2019-06-08 17:47:00,"Iowa, we‚Äôre heading your way next week and hope to see you there! Go to https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to an event in your community."
Biden,2019-06-08 18:32:00,"Across America, mayors are stepping up and leading the way on combating climate change. Thank you to @MartyForBoston for showing me the innovative work Boston is doing to protect the city from rising sea levels and increased flooding. https://t.co/LZKp6WNWlj"
Biden,2019-06-09 00:11:00,The Bidens are celebrating my daughter Ashley‚Äôs birthday today. @DrBiden and I are so proud of everything she has accomplished and can‚Äôt wait to see what she achieves in the years ahead. https://t.co/XlUZHSBMKp
Biden,2019-06-09 00:45:00,"Happy #BestFriendsDay to my friend, @BarackObama. https://t.co/JTd1t7NtyL"
Biden,2019-06-09 01:46:00,"Happy birthday to one of the strongest people Jill and I know, @GabbyGiffords. You are an inspiration to so many people. Your courage and your advocacy have made our country a better place."
Biden,2019-06-09 18:20:00,"As president, I‚Äôll lead America to become the world‚Äôs clean energy superpower.

https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo https://t.co/rzeIcuW9BW"
Biden,2019-06-09 20:28:00,"Jill &amp; I were thrilled to be there today to watch our amazing granddaughter Maisy graduate. Maisy, you make us so proud &amp; we can‚Äôt wait to see what you do next with your talent, smarts, dedication and kindness. The future is yours, and Nana &amp; Pop will always be right behind you. https://t.co/zj80Kee4l3"
Biden,2019-06-10 14:32:00,"President Trump‚Äôs decision to abandon the #ParisAgreement wasn't just reckless‚Äîit abdicated our leadership on the world stage and threatened the future of our planet.
 
On day one, I‚Äôll rejoin the Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further. https://t.co/0Wxk0RIYvs"
Biden,2019-06-10 18:10:00,It was great to be back in Atlanta! Thank you to Mayor @KeishaBottoms for showing me around town and for your work expanding opportunity to every corner of the city. https://t.co/kmhmeN5lHm
Biden,2019-06-10 22:46:00,I'm headed to eastern Iowa this week to talk with voters about our vision for the future. Head to https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to an event in your community.
Biden,2019-06-11 17:51:00,"Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here. We‚Äôre taking over to keep you in the loop on our event in Ottumwa, Iowa. Stay tuned! #TeamJoe"
Biden,2019-06-11 17:55:00,"When it comes to President Trump‚Äôs tariff war with China, one thing is clear: America‚Äôs farmers and manufacturers are getting crushed ‚Äì no one knows that better than Iowa. 

To Trump, the people getting hurt are just pawns in his game. #TeamJoe"
Biden,2019-06-11 17:56:00,Tune in here: https://t.co/4rTMVjJzyb
Biden,2019-06-11 17:57:00,"He thinks he‚Äôs being tough. Well, it‚Äôs easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump‚Äôs tariffs? #TeamJoe"
Biden,2019-06-11 17:59:00,"Trump doesn‚Äôt get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.

The cashiers at Target see what‚Äôs going on ‚Äì they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe"
Biden,2019-06-11 18:01:00,We can‚Äôt afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe
Biden,2019-06-11 18:21:00,Thank you for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to keep up with everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe
Biden,2019-06-11 18:45:00,Good luck to the @USWNT as they kick off their first game of the Women‚Äôs World Cup. @DrBiden and I will be rooting for you! We have no doubt you‚Äôll make our country proud. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/BCtOFAtSRt
Biden,2019-06-11 20:00:00,President Trump is bringing his secret one page agreement with Mexico to Iowa. The Iowans being crushed by his tariffs would like to see it.
Biden,2019-06-11 23:26:00,"Tomorrow, we‚Äôre heading to Clinton, Iowa, and hope to see you there! RSVP at https://t.co/MwCakzlMdm and spread the word to family and friends."
Biden,2019-06-12 01:10:00,President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.
Biden,2019-06-12 18:36:00,"Three years later, the horrific attack on Pulse Nightclub still shakes our nation to the core. A night that should have been a celebration of love and life was cut short by unspeakable terror. Today, we remember those we lost ‚Äî including so many in the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/vdNyZEjlRr"
Biden,2019-06-12 18:36:00,"Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic."
Biden,2019-06-12 19:30:00,"Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country ‚Äî selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve. 

Thank you, Jon Stewart, for continuing to have their backs. https://t.co/AHvAupqIyc"
Biden,2019-06-12 20:29:00,"Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia‚Äîa decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.

The decision reminds us progress doesn‚Äôt happen on its own‚Äîevery generation has to fight for it."
Biden,2019-06-12 22:34:00,We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country ‚Äî the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! https://t.co/49jUzP89F1
Biden,2019-06-13 01:32:00,President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn‚Äôt about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
Biden,2019-06-13 15:10:00,"I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/R6xaN3vXGT"
Biden,2019-06-13 16:45:00,"Had great pancakes and great conversation at Tasty Cafe in Eldridge before heading to Clinton Community College for our final event this trip. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa! https://t.co/gONhYR1gRf"
Biden,2019-06-14 02:36:00,Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits ‚Äî and the right to collectively bargain. I‚Äôm proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit
Biden,2019-06-14 10:02:00,"Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He‚Äôs dead wrong.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/Zw7DKYXc1h https://t.co/3NGezt58hx"
Biden,2019-06-14 14:42:00,This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people ‚Äî not Vladimir Putin.
Biden,2019-06-14 16:03:00,"The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom."
Biden,2019-06-15 15:25:00,"In America, no child‚Äôs future should be determined by their zip code, parents‚Äô income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we‚Äôll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Read the plan here: https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt"
Biden,2019-06-15 18:20:00,"This country wasn‚Äôt built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It‚Äôs time we recognize that.

We‚Äôve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth."
Biden,2019-06-16 10:00:00,"As my father believed, there‚Äôs no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children‚Äîand all our children‚Äîto be honorable, generous, kind young men and women. https://t.co/6B8hbfOIft"
Biden,2019-06-16 15:50:00,"Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile! 

As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it‚Äôs past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/bJQZm2aQMv"
Biden,2019-06-16 21:39:00,"7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.

DREAMers are Americans. It‚Äôs time we kept our word to them."
Biden,2019-06-17 18:47:00,"Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into ""Mother Emanuel"" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation."
Biden,2019-06-17 20:01:00,"Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôm committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent."
Biden,2019-06-17 21:06:00,"I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today‚Äôs #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum."
Biden,2019-06-17 21:06:00,"I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power ‚Äî whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it‚Äôs our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it.

That starts with access to a real living wage ‚Äî a $15 minimum wage."
Biden,2019-06-17 21:06:00,"I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we‚Äôll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child‚Äôs future should be determined by their zip code, parents‚Äô income, race, or disability. https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV"
Biden,2019-06-17 21:06:00,"I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote."
Biden,2019-06-17 21:06:00,"Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it."
Biden,2019-06-17 21:06:00,"It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion."
Biden,2019-06-17 22:10:00,"Happy anniversary to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. I‚Äôm forever grateful you agreed to spend the rest of your life with me. I love you, Jilly! https://t.co/HwCQIjFc4J"
Biden,2019-06-18 00:01:00,"Under President Trump‚Äôs policies, a four-month-old was separated from his family at the border. It‚Äôs unconscionable and fundamentally at odds with everything our nation stands for.

America is better than this. https://t.co/hQY3xISf7r"
Biden,2019-06-18 14:25:00,"This weekend, I‚Äôm heading to South Carolina for the @SCDP Convention and world-famous #ClyburnFishFry! RSVP to come out and join us: https://t.co/r0RlGVVUmE"
Biden,2019-06-18 16:05:00,"I‚Äôll be taking the stage at 9PM ET on June 27 for the first Democratic debate!

We‚Äôre organizing debate watch parties in every corner of the country for the big night and need your help. Sign up to host one in your community: https://t.co/3TRBR6Fz8i"
Biden,2019-06-18 18:49:00,It‚Äôs past time for a $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/PQf5I3Qxzp

Biden,2019-06-18 20:40:00,"For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten ‚Äî this fight is not over.

We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality. https://t.co/aCoWE0hggC"
Biden,2019-06-19 01:05:00,"Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn‚Äôt want to hear as ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS‚Äù -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:"
Biden,2019-06-19 01:05:00,"Let‚Äôs be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he‚Äôs in the process of squandering it."
Biden,2019-06-19 01:05:00,"Just look at his tax plan.

As president, Biden will reverse Trump‚Äôs tax cuts for the super wealthy. It‚Äôs time we reward work, not just wealth.
https://t.co/byDWQAumwg"
Biden,2019-06-19 01:34:00,"Trump continues to undermine our standing in the world.

Our core values of inclusivity, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are under attack here at home and abroad."
Biden,2019-06-19 01:34:00,"Trump‚Äôs response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it‚Äôs not just that. It‚Äôs happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections. 

We‚Äôre better than this."
Biden,2019-06-19 01:34:00,"This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it‚Äôs going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.

Join our team today and let‚Äôs get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW"
Biden,2019-06-19 22:05:00,"Trump‚Äôs policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it."
Biden,2019-06-19 22:05:00,President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/0NE6CitDKM
Biden,2019-06-19 23:10:00,"America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness‚Äîbut has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they‚Äôre black."
Biden,2019-06-19 23:10:00,"As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we‚Äôve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we‚Äôre working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations."
Biden,2019-06-20 15:01:00,President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
Biden,2019-06-20 15:01:00,He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran‚Äôs aggression in the region.
Biden,2019-06-20 15:01:00,"But they‚Äôve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal ‚Äì instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability."
Biden,2019-06-20 15:01:00,"It‚Äôs sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.

By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need."
Biden,2019-06-20 15:01:00,Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
Biden,2019-06-20 15:01:00,"What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies."
Biden,2019-06-20 17:32:00,This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street ‚Äî a movement that has delivered so much acceptance &amp; hope &amp; pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever. https://t.co/i2ShQVIKjm
Biden,2019-06-20 22:35:00,"We have to take on the epidemic of violence against the transgender community ‚Äî especially trans women of color. Ten trans women have been killed violently in 2019 so far.

We must stand up, speak out, and put an end to this hate. https://t.co/FxW38cG6xQ"
Biden,2019-06-20 23:25:00,"Climate change poses an existential threat to our communities, economy, national security, and environment.

Biden,2019-06-21 17:25:00,"President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes and attack the progress we‚Äôve made on climate change. It‚Äôs unacceptable. 

In a Biden Administration, we‚Äôll turbocharge our efforts to achieve a 100% clean energy economy.

Biden,2019-06-22 22:32:00,"I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women ‚Äî and particularly women of color ‚Äî have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population."
Biden,2019-06-22 22:32:00,"Planned Parenthood helps women and individuals get the health care they need ‚Äî especially preventive services like cancer screenings, mammograms, checkups, and contraception.

Thank you to @PPact for having me at today‚Äôs #WeDecide Forum to discuss these important issues. https://t.co/6P5MoAJ39V"
Biden,2019-06-23 01:30:00,"Trump‚Äôs erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don‚Äôt need another war in the Middle East, but Trump‚Äôs actions toward Iran only make that more likely."
Biden,2019-06-23 17:40:00,"The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are ‚Äúsafe and sanitary‚Äù.

It‚Äôs an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better."

Biden,2019-06-25 15:18:00,"We must secure our borders, but ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù is a slogan divorced from reality. We need to focus on improving screening procedures at our legal ports of entry &amp; making smart investments in border technology. These policies will do more for our security than a wall ever could."
Biden,2019-06-25 19:34:00,"Civil rights was one of the things that got me engaged in politics. Six years after Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights are under attack across the country. And that‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm running for president today.

We must renew our efforts to protect the right to vote. https://t.co/IXrZ8dJWRq"

Biden,2019-06-26 16:15:00,"DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats."
Biden,2019-06-26 17:55:00,"One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban‚Äîone of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it‚Äôs not who we are."
Biden,2019-06-26 18:56:00,This image is gut-wrenching. The cruelty we're seeing at our border is unconscionable.

This is not America.https://t.co/ZeMBmwUHxU
Biden,2019-06-26 20:15:00,"All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges.

Biden,2019-06-27 00:00:00,"I was proud to sign @IndivisibleTeam‚Äôs pledge.

The most important thing is to beat Donald Trump. Period. https://t.co/KiBiOOZpDm"
Biden,2019-06-27 16:15:00,Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn‚Äôt have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans ‚Äî another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.
Biden,2019-06-27 16:53:00,"Today‚Äôs decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy."
Biden,2019-06-27 16:53:00,"Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It‚Äôs wrong and goes against our core values as a nation."
Biden,2019-06-27 18:58:00,"In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. I‚Äôm proud to stand in solidarity with airport workers across the country as they strike for their right to organize. #RespectUSworkers"
Biden,2019-06-27 21:33:00,"From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I‚Äôm building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney‚Äôs pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies.

Biden,2019-06-28 00:00:00,"In an hour, I‚Äôll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I‚Äôve said from day one, I‚Äôm running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone ‚Äî the middle class, and unify all Americans."
Biden,2019-06-28 00:04:00,"We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.

Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief."
Biden,2019-06-28 00:06:00,"Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path ‚Äì not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country."
Biden,2019-06-28 00:08:00,"We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation ‚Äì the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability."
Biden,2019-06-28 00:14:00,The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise ‚Äî made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.
Biden,2019-06-28 00:19:00,"It‚Äôs time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I‚Äôll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America‚Äôs future."
Biden,2019-06-28 00:21:00,We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President ‚Äì but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.
Biden,2019-06-28 00:24:00,"Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we‚Äôll guarantee that the poor ‚Äì who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion ‚Äì are automatically covered, free of charge."
Biden,2019-06-28 00:27:00,"We have to transform education. We‚Äôll provide universal Pre-K, triple Title I funding, raise teacher pay, double the number of mental health professionals in our schools, and eliminate disparities between rich and poor schools. https://t.co/6oqEuc5N8Q"
Biden,2019-06-28 00:30:00,"Climate change is an existential threat. We have to take urgent, drastic action now to address the climate emergency. On day one, I‚Äôll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on and rally the world to raise our ambitions. https://t.co/Tg2yqpL8DO"
Biden,2019-06-28 00:31:00,We can do all this and more ‚Äì all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That‚Äôs the only way we‚Äôre going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.
Biden,2019-06-28 00:35:00,"We have to choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. I hope you‚Äôll tune in tonight as we discuss these important issues and more. If you like what you hear, I ask you to join us by signing up at https://t.co/FiM7U862fT. Let‚Äôs get to work."
Biden,2019-06-28 00:38:00,"I‚Äôm about to take the debate stage. The large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemDebate"

Biden,2019-07-01 19:07:00,"Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un ‚Äî a murderous tyrant ‚Äî on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing."

Biden,2019-07-01 19:07:00,"Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage."
Biden,2019-07-01 19:07:00,"And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal ‚Äî a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb."
Biden,2019-07-01 19:07:00,"Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results."
Biden,2019-07-01 19:07:00,"Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive. Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East.

Biden,2019-07-02 23:18:00,"The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination."
Biden,2019-07-02 23:18:00,"It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow ‚Äî from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We‚Äôre all made better."
Biden,2019-07-02 23:18:00,"But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all."
Biden,2019-07-03 00:53:00,"Tomorrow, I‚Äôm heading to Iowa with @DrBiden to talk with voters about our bold vision for the future. We hope you‚Äôll come out and join us! Head to https://t.co/jXap7UviAc to¬†RSVP. https://t.co/XoOuhxbqBB"

Biden,2019-07-03 13:55:00,"El Departamento de Comercio anunci√≥ que el formulario Censo 2020 no tendr√° la pregunta de ciudadan√≠a de Trump. Esto no es solo una victoria para los inmigrantes y latinos, sino para todos los estadounidenses. Todos merecemos ser contados sin temor!"
Biden,2019-07-03 14:49:00,"Rooms of people packed body to body. Kids being held without access to showers or a change of clothes. It‚Äôs simply abhorrent.

We all have a moral obligation to keep speaking out until this administration ends these inhumane policies once and for all. https://t.co/KrxqXcHV9p"
Biden,2019-07-03 19:32:00,"South Carolina, I‚Äôm heading your way this weekend to talk with you about how we‚Äôll build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along. Head to https://t.co/ie4M0dWVIR to RSVP for an event in your community."
Biden,2019-07-03 21:55:00,DREAMers‚Äîyoung people who came to the U.S. as children‚Äîare Americans. They don‚Äôt deserve to sit in limbo as the Supreme Court decides whether President Trump can end the Obama-Biden DACA policy. Congress should act now to give them a path to citizenship. https://t.co/4teULJvgki

Biden,2019-07-04 13:45:00,"America is an idea ‚Äî stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.

That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly"
Biden,2019-07-04 17:31:00,"It‚Äôs fitting that we‚Äôre celebrating Independence Day in Independence, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who said hello at this morning‚Äôs #FourthOfJuly parade ‚Äî it was great to see so many supporters! https://t.co/tEOXY8wLAn"
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"As I celebrate today with friends &amp; family, I am reflecting on the promise those rebels envisioned 243 years ago. America hasn‚Äôt lived up to that promise for most people‚Äîbut we‚Äôve never stopped trying. We must continue in our pursuit until we achieve equality &amp; liberty for all."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"We have to be against his policies that are further entrenching economic inequality in this nation. That are rigging the system against the middle class.

That too is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"It‚Äôs not enough to be against the way Donald Trump conducts himself ‚Äî we have to be against the way he assaults the dignity of women, people of color, and immigrants."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"We have to take on the inequalities in our system that are causing too many today‚Äîin America and around the world‚Äîto question their faith in the ability of democracy to deliver for them.

It‚Äôs not enough to be for political equality. We have to be for economic fairness as well."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"My liberty, depends on yours. Our liberty as a nation rests on our ability to ensure equal access and equal opportunity ‚Äî not just for our own children, but all our children."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"America is the heart of the Free World, and we must defend it. That is how the #FourthOfJuly is best honored ‚Äî by remembering that our Declaration is first and foremost a call to arms, in defense of liberty."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"And ever since then, presidents and patriots have gathered together on the Fourth to reflect on the greater meaning of our American experiment."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men ‚Äî and women ‚Äî are created equal."
Biden,2019-07-04 19:26:00,"But we must also remember, as JFK put it, that ours is ‚Äúnot the individual liberty of one but the indivisible liberty of all.‚Äù Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt get that."
Biden,2019-07-04 21:32:00,What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
Biden,2019-07-04 21:32:00,"Will he offer a robust defense of the democratic values that have always been our strength in times of crisis? We all know the answer to that.

Donald Trump is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because he doesn‚Äôt get it."
Biden,2019-07-04 21:32:00,"Every year on the #FourthOfJuly, presidents, elected leaders, and everyday Americans come together at parades, bbqs, and baseball games to celebrate humankind‚Äôs highest ideal ‚Äî liberty. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre celebrating today in Iowa."
Biden,2019-07-04 23:01:00,"We just wrapped up a great event in Marshalltown, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us on this #FourthOfJuly! https://t.co/z6mHBLcPWQ"

Biden,2019-07-09 19:22:00,"The Affordable Care Act was and is a big deal. It covered 20 million more people, protects more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and expanded Medicaid ‚Äî giving millions of Americans the peace of mind that comes with health insurance."
Biden,2019-07-09 19:22:00,"We can‚Äôt tear down the ACA. We should protect and build on it. In America, health care should be a right‚Äînot a privilege.

As president, I‚Äôll do everything in my power to stand up to the attacks on the ACA and expand coverage to ensure everyone has access to the care they need."
Biden,2019-07-09 19:59:00,"The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately."

Biden,2019-07-13 20:55:00,President Trump‚Äôs ICE raids are inhumane. His scare tactics solve nothing. We shouldn't be terrorizing communities and splitting up families. We should provide a pathway to citizenship and find a lasting solution.

Biden,2019-07-29 21:01:00,.@TheRevAl is a champion in the fight for civil rights. The fact that President Trump continues to use the power of the presidency to unleash racist attacks on the people he serves is despicable. This hate has no place in our country. It's beneath the dignity of the office.
Biden,2019-07-29 22:33:00,The Affordable Care Act changed the life of @DrBiden‚Äôs sister ‚Äî like it did millions of Americans ‚Äî by giving her access to the health care she needed. We can‚Äôt afford to start over. https://t.co/ixdpu8bQGv
Biden,2019-07-29 23:15:00,"We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop America‚Äôs gun violence epidemic ‚Äî that starts with taking on the powerful gun lobby and passing common-sense gun safety laws.

I‚Äôve beaten the @NRA twice. And I‚Äôll do it again in the White House."
Biden,2019-07-30 00:58:00,"Two years ago, President Trump gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he wants to rip free school lunches away from kids who need help the most. It‚Äôs heartless. No kid should go hungry in America. https://t.co/TybdVnFjLH"
Biden,2019-07-30 18:32:00,"President Trump has failed on his promises for American workers time and time again. We need to rebuild the middle class, and this time make sure everybody comes along ‚Äî regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. https://t.co/Df7rHBCzLp"

Biden,2019-07-30 22:12:00,"President Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos continue to roll back our progress on LGBTQ rights. No child should feel unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Biden,2019-07-31 23:51:00,"As we gather in Detroit, it‚Äôs important that we recognize the significance of the Motor City. Because few cities embody the American spirit better than Detroit.

When it was knocked down flat on its back, it didn‚Äôt give up. It came roaring back."
Biden,2019-07-31 23:51:00,"Detroit ‚Äî and our country as a whole ‚Äî is like its people: resilient and tough. Defined by a work ethic that is unmatched by any place in the world. And when given half a fighting chance, there‚Äôs nothing the American people can‚Äôt do."
Biden,2019-07-31 23:51:00,"Tonight, I‚Äôll take the stage in Detroit for the second #DemDebate. I‚Äôm excited to have the opportunity to discuss the issues on voters‚Äô minds, why I‚Äôm running for president, and my bold vision for the future of our country."

Biden,2019-08-01 00:31:00,"Healthcare is the most important issue to Americans. Senator Harris won't be able to beat Trump with double-talk on healthcare.
We have a plan that builds on the ACA by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate."
Biden,2019-08-01 00:33:00,Americans prefer protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option over Medicare for All: https://t.co/tNlPVLG1v8
Biden,2019-08-01 00:36:00,"In America, health care should be a right for all -- not a privilege for the wealthy few.

Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to protect and build on Obamacare is the best way to achieve universal coverage and lower costs: https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C https://t.co/jtA88ylrdp"
Biden,2019-08-01 00:42:00,I‚Äôm running for president to restore the soul of this country...No one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It‚Äôs too strong. We're too good. https://t.co/qUDRRuY5Rg
Biden,2019-08-01 00:44:00,Senator Harris‚Äô Medicare for All plan still gets rid of employer-sponsored coverage and still costs 30x more than Joe Biden‚Äôs health care plan. Just changing the start date by 6 years doesn‚Äôt change the fact it is bad policy. #DemDebate https://t.co/CsBtsTevWE
Biden,2019-08-01 00:48:00,"As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma. 

As president, he'll enforce our mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services."
Biden,2019-08-01 00:50:00,"Because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans gained health insurance. Millions more gained critical protections. But the work isn‚Äôt over. As president, Biden won‚Äôt rest until everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they deserve. #DemDebate"
Biden,2019-08-01 00:52:00,Let‚Äôs get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden‚Äôs health care plan‚Äîand it will be paid for by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate https://t.co/dlyVfenQFg
Biden,2019-08-01 01:00:00,"Donald Trump is the problem with our immigration policy. He's using family separation as a weapon against desperate people seeking safety and a better life.

We need to defeat Donald Trump. #DemDebate"
Biden,2019-08-01 01:09:00,Trump's immigration policies are an assault on human dignity. We aren't a country that denies children soap and a toothbrush. This is not who we are. #DemDebate
Biden,2019-08-01 01:09:00,Las pol√≠ticas de inmigraci√≥n de Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana. No somos un pa√≠s que niegue a los ni√±os jab√≥n y cepillo de dientes. Esto no es lo que somos. #DemDebate
Biden,2019-08-01 01:12:00,"Under Medicare for All, Americans will see a new type of deductible in their paycheck. Medicare for All costs $30 trillion. Not sure what math they do in New York or California but that would be a lot of money. https://t.co/ifctf8g7pB"
Biden,2019-08-01 01:14:00,"Joe Biden has the boldest, most comprehensive criminal justice reform proposal in this election.

Biden,2019-08-01 01:52:00,"In 2009, the Obama-Biden administration made a big bet on rescuing the US auto industry. It paid off:

-More than 646,000 auto jobs
-Auto production doubled in the US
-Auto sales hit an all-time high

Detroit was on the front lines of that recovery.
#DemDebate"
Biden,2019-08-01 01:53:00,"Joe Biden has received more than 100 endorsements from community leaders around the country, including Detroit's own @MayorMikeDuggan.

Biden,2019-08-01 01:57:00,"Biden will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. He‚Äôll work to ensure that communities across the country from Flint, MI to Harlan, KY to the NH Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water."
Biden,2019-08-01 02:06:00,"When it comes to trade, either we're going to write the rules of the road for the world or China is‚Äîand not in a way that advances our values. 

Meanwhile, this administration has launched trade wars against the very allies we need with us to change China‚Äôs behavior.

#DemDebate"
Biden,2019-08-01 02:14:00,"This attack from Senator Gillibrand has been two weeks in the making, and it STILL isn‚Äôt accurate. Let's set the record straight:"
Biden,2019-08-01 02:14:00,"Here's the truth about Joe Biden's vote:

He wasn't opposed to the child care tax credit itself. He was opposed to this specific tax credit being made available to affluent people."
Biden,2019-08-01 02:16:00,"Joe Biden believes that women have a constitutional right to choose. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and Biden will work to codify it. He‚Äôll continue to fight for a woman‚Äôs right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor.
#DemDebate"
Biden,2019-08-01 02:24:00,"Joe Biden has long believed that the US should narrow rather than broaden its military efforts in Afghanistan, and has for years advocated for ending the war responsibly. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars a year to sustain a stalemate.

Biden,2019-08-02 01:21:00,"I was surprised at all of the attacks on President Obama's record at the #DemDebate. The Obama-Biden Administration passed Obamacare, lead the world on combating climate change, and saved our economy from the brink of disaster.

He was a great president. We don‚Äôt say that enough."
Biden,2019-08-02 15:09:00,There is nothing moderate about what President Obama did with Obamacare. Nothing. Seven presidents tried to expand access to health care ‚Äî the Obama-Biden Administration finally got it done. https://t.co/awe0f8r0H7
Biden,2019-08-02 16:25:00,"Yet more proof that Trump doesn‚Äôt care about the farmers, workers, and consumers that are being crushed by his irresponsible tariff war with China. It‚Äôs easy to act tough when someone else is feeling the pain.

Biden,2019-08-02 17:20:00,"America must defend the values that unite us‚Äîwe must lead the Free World.

Biden,2019-08-02 17:20:00,"Donald Trump is echoing his authoritarian heroes, again‚Äîthis time using China's anti-democracy talking points to describe the peaceful protests in Hong Kong as ""riots."" It's shameful.

When people suffering under oppression look to the U.S. for hope, Trump has nothing to offer."
Biden,2019-08-02 21:07:00,"In the last three years, President Trump has turned our world upside down internationally and economically. People are hurting. The soul of our country is collapsing because of his presidency.

How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It‚Äôs past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic."
Biden,2019-08-04 17:12:00,Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don‚Äôt belong on our streets. We must stand up to the @NRA and gun manufacturers‚Äîthey don‚Äôt own this country. We the people own this country.
Biden,2019-08-04 17:12:00,"We have to address what‚Äôs happening in America. We continue to bear witness to acts of terror carried out with a common thread: hatred of ‚Äúthe other.‚Äù We saw it in Charlottesville two years ago, at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, and now in El Paso."
Biden,2019-08-04 17:12:00,"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And in this moment, we all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We will give hate no safe harbor."
Biden,2019-08-04 17:12:00,"At least 29 lives stolen, families broken, communities shattered in El Paso and Dayton within 13 hours. Dozens more wounded. Between those two mass shootings, dozens more were killed and injured by gun violence that didn't make national headlines."
Biden,2019-08-04 23:02:00,"We can‚Äôt fix a problem if we refuse to name it: white nationalism. An ideology emboldened by a president who stokes the flames of hatred and coddles white supremacists with messages of support.

We must do what Trump won't: condemn this evil and eradicate it from our society."
Biden,2019-08-05 00:15:00,"Enough is enough. As a nation, we need to take common-sense steps to end this epidemic of gun violence.

@senatemajldr Mitch McConnell should reconvene the Senate and pass the House‚Äôs universal background check bill. We cannot wait to take action. https://t.co/0OLqH0xxcl"
Biden,2019-08-05 15:09:00,"Mr. President, immigration isn‚Äôt the problem. White nationalism is the problem. America‚Äôs inaction on gun safety legislation is the problem.

Biden,2019-08-05 16:14:00,"Let's be very clear. You use the office of the presidency to encourage and embolden white supremacy.

Biden,2019-08-06 18:58:00,"Thoughts and prayers won‚Äôt solve our broken gun laws. We need politicians with the courage to stand up to the powerful gun lobby and tell them that they don‚Äôt own this country.

I‚Äôve beaten the @NRA twice, and I‚Äôll do it again in the White House."
Biden,2019-08-06 20:47:00,"We can‚Äôt fix a problem if we refuse to name the problem. This is white nationalism. This is white supremacy. This is about hate.

Biden,2019-08-06 23:21:00,"The fight for civil rights is one of the things that got me engaged in politics. And when I was ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we successfully extended the #VotingRightsAct for 25 years."
Biden,2019-08-06 23:24:00,"But our job is not done. The #VotingRightsAct has been gutted by the Supreme Court &amp; voting rights are under siege across the country.

As president, I will restore the VRA, stand up to attacks on the right to vote, &amp; renew our efforts to ensure every American‚Äôs voice is equal."

Biden,2019-08-07 19:47:00,"When he said after Charlottesville that there were ‚Äúvery fine people on both sides‚Äù he gave license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.

Those words stunned the nation and shocked the world."

Not far at all."
Biden,2019-08-07 20:06:00,"In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."
Biden,2019-08-07 20:09:00,"I wish I could say this hate began with Trump and will end with him. It didn‚Äôt &amp; it won‚Äôt.

The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal &amp; the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart."

Biden,2020-03-21 01:12:00,The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He‚Äôs talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
Biden,2020-03-21 01:12:00,"Now he‚Äôs switched to falsely telling us that he‚Äôs taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he‚Äôs not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns."
Biden,2020-03-21 01:12:00,"In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president.

Biden,2020-03-22 21:45:00,"On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: ‚ÄúAnybody that wants a test can get a test.‚Äù

That was a flat-out lie then, and it‚Äôs still not true today. It‚Äôs a disgrace.

We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period."
Biden,2020-03-22 23:28:00,"We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now."

Biden,2020-03-22 23:28:00,"Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again."
